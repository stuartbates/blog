**Founders fix problems**

Most business ideas grow out of a founder's dissatisfaction or dislike for an issue they see as unjust, inefficient or simply unnecessary in the world.

**The two types of problem**

This issue can fall into one of two categories:
1. **A problem for the customer.** Some people will say that process looks really inefficient, let me fix it.
2. **A problem for the world.** Some people will say that process seems unfair, let me fix it.

Traditionally business has predominantly focused only on the first of these, the customer. The proposition is simple, the business offers some package of value designed for the customer and the customer pays in exchange for that.

However, more recently, we have seen people attempting to use business as a means of affecting problems in the wider-world. Two good examples of the moment are sustainability and diversity/equality/inclusion. 

**Value propositions**

Value props are what people buy and what you create.

Customers have a varied and complex set of priorities.

Some people value the wider-societal impact more. These will be your early-adopters.

The other needs might reduce slightly but they're still significant.

Founders addressing wider issues often fail to get traction because they focus too much on the wider issue and not enough on the core issues that affect the customer.

They do so in a belief that they need to cut down their scope to deliver as a small business - which they do. The problem is not that they cut scope, but rather that they draw the boundaries in the wrong places.

They lean towards their wider-issue, that's no surprise as it's what drove them to start the business in the first place. What I believe is the core problem is summed up nicely by this quote from Stephen Fry:

> I believe one of the greatest human failings is to prefer to be right, than to be effective.

**Wider business benefits**

- Marketing
- Employer brand (talent acquisition)
- More diversity business performance

**Game theory**

The problem is green energy started out more expensive, it makes you less competitive using it, so most people do not.

Finding diverse talent takes longer which in the short term makes you less competitive. This should be balanced out by the value a more diverse workforce brings to the business but the problem is lots of other characteristics impact performance and your sample size is so low so you often won't see or feel the benefits directly or obviously.

Game theory explains why this makes it difficult to launch a company like this.

The outcome you desire only arises from mass cooperation and collective effort. This is the prisoners dilemma, if we all cooperate we’re better off but if some people don’t cooperate then those that do, lose.

This dynamic exists with 2 prisoners, however, imagine how four or eight prisoners changes that dynamic. The more prisoners the more likely someone is to flip therefore the less likely any individual is to cooperate.

When problems require everyone to cooperate, no one does because they lose out.

**Competition Dynamics**

Easier to do when you have no competition.
